# 👋 Hello world, I'm Reagan!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a software engineer with an interest in AI solutions.

Much of my recent work lives in private Azure DevOps repos, so my GitHub commit activity might look quiet, but I'm definitely busy coding in the cloud!

When I'm not coding, you might find me on my horse or enjoying a good cup of coffee ☕.
